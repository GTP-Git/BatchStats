######### --- Physical Board Dynamics --- #########

-- Show bonus square counts by turn. Thus, by turn [turn] 50% of bonus squares are exhausted.

-- Games with least/most used bonus squares

-- Any games with all bonus squares used?

-- How does number of bonus squares used by a player relate to score?

-- Which TWS square has the highers/lowest avg score associated with it?

-- Board volatility? What board conditions lead to a big score?

-- Machine learning to determine board volatility? Winning chances?

-- Any examples of seven overlaps? 6? Highest scoring overlaps? Most overlaps in a single game?


######### --- Scoring --- #########


--"Home Run" Play Impact: Does the game_max_turn_score correlate strongly with the winner's score?
This would test the theory that one massive, game-changing play is more important than steady, consistent scoring.

-- Measures of single-game scoring volatility? 

-- Luck Factor: The schema for each move contains 'luck_factor': (float).
This is a pre-calculated value that measures how the value of tiles drawn compares to the expected value
of tiles drawn from the bag at that time. A positive luck factor means the player drew better-than-average tiles.
This is the single most valuable piece of data we can add next.
We should create a LuckFactorStatistic class that calculates the average luck factor for P1 and P2
over the whole game and adds it to the CSV.

-- Highest/lowest game score for each player

-- Highest/lowest total game score, both players combined


-- Higest single score play

-- How much of a player's score is attributable to bingos? Thus, how much is non-bingo scoring?

-- Power tile scoring? Esses? Blanks? Correlation with win%.

-- Greatest margin of victory

-- Greatest comeback

-- Game with the highest % of least/most probable words

-- How often is the player with the higest play in a game the winner?
















######### --- Bingos --- #########


-- Highest number of bingos in one game, single player and both players combined

-- Highest number of consecutive bingos, single player and both players combined





######### --- Blanks --- #########

-- Blank Drawing: how many blank tiles each player drew during the game.



######### --- Exchanging --- #########




######### --- Luck --- #########

-- Measures of luck, lowest/highest per turn/game

-- Record for most consonants/vowels drawn

-- avg score if a player draws both blanks, all four esses and all four power tiles (number of times this has happened,
and what percentage of the time it happens.






######### --- COMPLETED --- #########
                                                                                     

-- How does avg # of tiles per player per turn relate to scoring?

-- Is playing <=3 unique letters on the opening move is more/less better than playing >3 unique letters. The theory is that less unique letters allows for less 8-letter bingo opportunities for your opponent.
