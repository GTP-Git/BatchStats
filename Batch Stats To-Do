-- Show bonus square counts by turn

-- Any games with all bonus squares used?

-- How does number of bonus squares used by a player relate to score?

-- Which TWS square has the highers/lowest avg score associated with it?


######### --- Scoring --- #########

-- How does avg # of tiles player per turn relate to scoring?

--"Home Run" Play Impact: Does the game_max_turn_score correlate strongly with the winner's score?
This would test the theory that one massive, game-changing play is more important than steady, consistent scoring.

-- Luck Factor: The schema for each move contains 'luck_factor': (float).
This is a pre-calculated value that measures how the value of tiles drawn compares to the expected value
of tiles drawn from the bag at that time. A positive luck factor means the player drew better-than-average tiles.
This is the single most valuable piece of data we can add next.
We should create a LuckFactorStatistic class that calculates the average luck factor for P1 and P2
over the whole game and adds it to the CSV.

-- Highest/lowest game score for each player

-- Highest/lowest total game score, both players combined


-- Higest single score play

-- How much of a player's score is attributable to bingos? Thus, how much is non-bingo scoring?

-- Power tile scoring? Esses? Blanks? Correlation with win%.

-- Greatest margin of victory

-- Greatest comeback












######### --- Bingos --- #########


-- Highest number of bingos in one game, single player and both players combined

-- Highest number of consecutive bingos, single player and both players combined





######### --- Blanks --- #########

-- Blank Drawing: A simpler measure of luck. We can count how many blank tiles each player drew during the game.
The player who draws the blanks has a massive advantage.
